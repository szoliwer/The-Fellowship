# Project-wide Decisions

Decisions that affect more than one step, or the project as a whole. Decisions about a single step go in that step's `README.md`.

**Format** (newest at the top):
```
### D-### — Short title
- **Date / who:** YYYY-MM-DD — name
- **Decision:** what we chose
- **Why:** the reason, and what we considered instead
- **Affects:** which steps
```

### D-005 — Shared app, accounts and where private data is stored
- **Date / who:** 2026-10-03 — Herman
- **Decision:** The shared Streamlit app is `app.py` at the repo root (run: `.venv/bin/streamlit run app.py`); each step keeps its logic and screens in its own folder and `app.py` only shows them. `.streamlit/config.toml` keeps the app on this laptop only and turns off Streamlit's usage statistics. Accounts (email + password, salted scrypt hashes) live in SQLite at `data/fellowship.db`; user records are also written to `data/users.json`. Each user's imports live in `data/sources/<user_id>.json`, with original files and upload history in `data/uploads/<user_id>/`. Step 1 adds `source_type`s `claude_json` and `text_file` and `provenance.upload_id` to the brief's `SourceContextV1`.
- **Why:** users need to come back to their data; SQLite and scrypt are built into Python (no new installs); keeping files per user makes ownership obvious and matches D-004's "steps pass data as files". Considered: a hosted login service (too slow to set up for the hackathon).
- **Affects:** all steps (shared app, data locations); Step 2 reads the new `source_type`s.

### D-004 — Stack Choice; `main` changes only via pull request
- **Date / who:** 2026-10-03 — Herman
- **Decision:** Stack for the MVP: Python + Streamlit. Each step is plain Python code in its own folder that reads input files and writes output files; one Streamlit app is the shell that runs the steps and shows the screens. Steps pass data as files (e.g. the Noise Filter → Idea Generation handoff). 
- **Why:** one language for a mostly non-technical team, fast to build at a hackathon, and keeping steps separate from the screens means the UI could be replaced later without touching the pipeline. Demo runs locally on one laptop; the Claude API key lives in a git-ignored .env file.
- **Affects:** all steps

### D-003 — One branch per step; `main` changes only via pull request
- **Date / who:** 2026-10-03 — Oliver
- **Decision:** Seven working branches (`step-0-user-registration` … `step-6-matching-interface`). Each branch only changes its own step folder. Work reaches `main` through a pull request reviewed by a teammate. Shared docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/*`) are edited on `main`.
- **Why:** Keeps `main` demo-able at all times, and keeps four people's work-in-progress from breaking each other. Limiting each branch to its own folder avoids merge conflicts.
- **Affects:** all steps

### D-002 — Privacy baseline
- **Date / who:** 2026-10-03 — team
- **Decision:** Uploads are opt-in. Raw chat text never leaves the pipeline. Other users see only extracted ideas and the warm intro. Contact details are shared only on a mutual accept. No real user data or API keys in GitHub (`data/` and `.env` are git-ignored).
- **Why:** Chat histories are very personal. Trust is the product.
- **Affects:** all steps

### D-001 — Repo structure and working rules
- **Date / who:** 2026-10-03 — team
- **Decision:** One folder per pipeline step (0–6), each with a `README.md` holding its spec and its decisions/progress/fixes logs. `CLAUDE.md` is the shared rulebook for AI assistants. Nothing is committed without a teammate saying yes.
- **Why:** Four people working in parallel at a hackathon need clear ownership and a shared record of what changed.
- **Affects:** all steps

## Open questions (to decide as a team)
- **Tech stack:** What do we build the app in? (e.g. a no-code tool, Streamlit/Python, or a simple web app.) Pick whatever the team can demo fastest.
- **Which LLM** do we use for idea extraction and warm intros, and who holds the API key?
- **Common conversation format** shared between Steps 1 → 2 → 3 (draft in `1 - Data Collection/README.md`).
- **Similar vs. complementary:** do we show both kinds of match in one list, or as two separate lists?
